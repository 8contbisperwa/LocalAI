## What is Video Copilot Optical Flares for Nuke and what are its main features?
  
Video Copilot Optical Flares for Nuke is a plug-in that allows you to create realistic lens flares and light effects in Nuke. It is based on the popular Optical Flares plug-in for After Effects, but optimized for Nuke's 3D compositing environment. It has the following main features:

- Custom Lens Flare Editor: You can create your own flares from scratch or modify the existing ones using a user-friendly interface. You can adjust the parameters of each flare element, such as position, scale, color, brightness, rotation, etc. You can also add textures, dirt, chromatic aberration, and dynamic edge animations to your flares.
- Visual Preset Library: You can access over 100 presets and 90 photographic textures that are included with the plug-in. You can also save and share your own presets with others.
- 3D Integration: You can use Nuke's 3D lights and geometry to control the position and obscuration of your flares. You can also use Nuke's camera data to match the perspective and depth of field of your flares.
- Render Node Licenses: You can purchase render node licenses separately for Optical Flares for Nuke. This allows you to render your projects on multiple machines without having to install the full plug-in on each one.

## How to install and activate the plug-in?
